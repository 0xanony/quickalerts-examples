### How to Use QuickAlerts
To use QuickAlerts, you'll need to create an account on the [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=quickalerts-examples) website. Once you have an account, you can create alerts using a predefined expression template or create one on your own.

- Click the "Create QuickAlert" button.
- Name your alert and select the chain and network you'd like your alert on.
- Select a Blank Template or one of our pre-defined templates. If you're using an expression from the [example library](#example-library), then click Blank Template.
- Review the expression if you clicked a pre-defined template, or add your expression in the "Create Expression" field.
- Test your expression and hit "Next"
- Create your destination and Deploy your alert!

Once you've created an alert, QuickAlerts will monitor the selected blockchain for the specified event. When the event occurs, QuickAlerts will send you a notification according to the method you chose.
